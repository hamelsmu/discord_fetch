    "## Features\n",
    "- Fetches complete channel history including threads\n",
    "- Organizes messages hierarchically (parent → thread messages)\n",
    "- Supports both active and archived threads\n",
    "- Provides clean, structured output for analysis\n",

    "   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Ensure your bot has Read Message History permissions\n",

Without it, I'd have to grab a much larger random sample to get enough signal for the least prevalent categories.

Are you referring to the same labeled data (for Agent dev and for LLM-as-Judge dev?) or these are different sets of labelled data? I was confused because to properly calibrate the judge (calculate the TPS and TNR) we will need examples of only the failure mode “Helpful response”, where the input is an ambiguous query and then the output should be a follow-up question to clarify, right? \\n- Assuming these datasets are two different ones (one for Agent Development and one for LLM-as-Judge of amiguous inputs), does this mean we will have several datasets in our evals, and this dataset will be only for “Ambiguous inputs”, and then we will build metrics specific to those failure modes? I can imagine some metrics being applicable to every trace (e.g. JSON Schema correctness) and other metrics such as \"Correct_answer_to_ambiguous_questions\" being only applicable to the inputs that trigger this failure mode. \\n- The split criteria is a randomized split or should be targeted split for balance between pass and fail labels? \\n\\nIf the question is confusing I can record a short video explaining what I mean.',\n",

But I learnt the hard way that if users and stakeholders depend on it in production, you really want to test.\\n2. If it's simple then the eval set and harness is also simple. You can quite easily generate synthetic data and then continue updating the set as you get examples from production. Especially if anything goes wrong. And if the output string is predictable, you don't even need an LLM judge, you can do string comparison (for example), or a simple text comparison method.\\n3. It's worth going through an exercise of thinking defensively - what might go wrong? For example, since it's taking in user-inputted text ... what kinds of weird inputs might trip the implementation? What happens if the text is in the wrong language? If it's misspelled? If it contains confusing instructions to the LLM, etc ...\",\n",

Label a Gold Dataset\\nNext, humans annotate a set of model outputs using the rubric.\\nWe build a balanced set of:\\n* ✅ Human-labeled Pass cases (no hallucination)\\n* ❌ Human-labeled Fail cases (hallucination observed)\\n📦 Typically, we label 50–100 examples for a reliable evaluation baseline.\\n\\n✅ 3. Split the Data\\nWe split this labeled dataset into:\\n* Train: ~10% used as few-shot examples inside the LLM judge prompt\\n* Dev: ~40–45% to tune the prompt and test early results\\n* Test: ~40–45% held out to evaluate the judge's true accuracy\\n🎯 Key Rule: Test examples should never be reused in prompt, to avoid overfitting.\\n\\n✅ 4.

For guardrails I don’t recommend using LLM judges unless (a) your judge runs fast, and (b) your judge has low false positive rate. That is, your judge should not fail & cause a retry if the output is actually good. So my recommendation is to determine the cost of your LLM judge guardrail (not just money; consider latency and unnecessary retries due to false positives), and if the cost outweighs the benefit, then it would make sense to deploy. \\n\\nWe will talk about CI CD in week 3!',\n",
